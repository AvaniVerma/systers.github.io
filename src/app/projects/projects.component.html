			<h1 class="mx-auto mb-5"> OUR PROJECTS</h1>
			<p>Our projects focus on impacting users and communities by improving their lives with technology. We use various development
				languages and technologies, while encouraging our contributors to learn new skills and solve new challenges. We host
				all of our code on GitHub, where contributors can publish and store their code, connect with other open source communities,
				and learn version control with Git. Github tracks your personal contributions, so you can share them as part of your
				portfolio.

			<h1 class="mx-auto mt-5 mb-5">PEACE CORPS PROJECTS</h1>
			<p>The Peace Corps has had nearly 220,000 volunteers (PCVs) in 151 countries around the world since its creation in 1961.
				Great technology projects are started for the Peace Corps, usually at codeathons, but they are rarely complete enough
				to deploy to the PCVs. Systers takes on these projects, completes them, then works with Peace Corps administrators to
				test and deploy in the field.
				<br>Please note that these projects have been archived until AnitaB.org finds new contacts within the Peace Corps to finish
				and test them in the field.</p>

			<p>Systers has very specific needs with managing volunteers. We have the Volunteer Management System and Systers Portal to
				help Systers and volunteers to make an engaged connection. We also maintain the Systers GNU Mailman and apply our customized
				features to the latest release. Our customized version, is very complex and has a high difficulty level for developers.
				Weâ€™re also working on a new project to help manage our community's meetups.</p>
